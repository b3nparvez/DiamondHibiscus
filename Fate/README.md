This is a simple program that creates a number of people according to you the user. And assigns and ranks them with 
RANDOM numbers. The first person, going first and ect. This is was wasn't challenging to make at all.
Yet it was done because my friends and I couldn't choose who would go first in whatever things we did. So
i simply decided to make a program on the spot, to see who should go, chosen by complete random fate.
