WELCOME TO THE MOST BEST PROGRAM EVER WHEN IT COMES TO BLACKJACK, this program is designed to be
     * exactly like blackjack. Here is how
     *
     * the user and two smart opponents(a.i) are given two cards. for the user, you can see your own cards
     * but for the opponents cards, you only see thier first card like in blackjack, you can't see
     * thier other cards that they can recive. if you would like a card. you say "hit" if you don't you
     * saw "nah". same rules apply for the A.I. face cards are worth 10 and the ace card can be
     * changed to an 11 or 1. at the end the totals are tallied up, whoever has the highest score, wins!
     * but that's only if you didn't bust. Your oponnets have names that are randomized so it won't
     * feel too sad and unrealistic. the program at the end also asks you to pick a random number
     * for a prize so you won't feel bad about losing
     *
