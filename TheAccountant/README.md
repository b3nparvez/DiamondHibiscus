This is a program designed to save your money!! Its always a hassle to make a budget for yourself. 
Now it's automated! This program asks you some questions. 
      How much money do you want to save? 
      How much money do you have saved already?
      What day is it and what day do you want to have said money?
After those few simple questions, the program devises how much money you need to save up each week. 
It even gets into extra details about how much days it is between now and then, and send you a message 
depending on how much you need to save. Hence the reason the program is called "the accountant." This program isn't 
too difficult to make in my own opinion. Yet I wanted to make this program because I 
simply didn't like calculating things over and over. It took some arithmatic and design planning. But this
is one of the programs I have made in little over a couple hours. I hope you can use it if you
ever want to budget your money!
