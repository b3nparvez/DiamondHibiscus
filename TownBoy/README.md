This is a project from my 350 Applications of DataBases Class. In this you can register for an account, log in, and place a zipcode to see the restruants 
around you. You can search for restruant types or the restruant itself. It even helps complete the search by auto-filling. It does this with super search. 
It completes this task by cross-refrencing the zipcode given, to the database. It grabs the data from that and returns it to the user. When you make an account, 
it keeps record of your zipcode. This is so multiple users can use the website and save thier own address without compromising thier security. As of now, there is currently 
2 zipcodes that have all the restruants around them. More can be inputed later, or an addition to the algorithm; where the program grabs thier data for the database, in
other websites. 

Java is my main focus and most profficiant language I can code in; however, I recently thought it would be best to show another language I can code in. That being Javascript. 
This is the best program I have in that language, to show my abilities.
