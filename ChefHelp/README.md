This program will keep record of all foods you purcahse. It will keep track of dates of the food, nutritional value, and notify you each time you log in when things MAY expire. 
This feature is implimented to make sure you do not leave rotting food or lose track of ingrediants. Not only does it remind you, but it organizes them in a list for 
easier viewing. Another function of this program, is that it cross refrences your items to recipes. If you have the correct amount of items for a recipe, it will display.
If you have most, it will tell you what to buy, and if you want to know what you would like to make- it can show you things. 

As you insert in food, you will have to type it down. But if it's a common food, average details will be automaticly inputed. It will be as simple as typing up a grocery list. 
If the ChefHelp recognized some food that have specific experation dates, ie milk, it will ask and shouldn't take long. No longer will you have to worry about what foods 
will go to waste. And no longer would you have to think about what you can make to eat. Recipes will tell you how to make things step by step. 

Currently it is still under development, However, it should not take long to complete. I orginally planned for this to be just for used by one user at a time. But i want to
expand this to be used online. That way many people can keep track of thier own fridge. This would require me to code it in java script and make my own back and frontend. 
The reason why i am not doing this now, is because i finish what i start. So i will make my own personal version in java first.
