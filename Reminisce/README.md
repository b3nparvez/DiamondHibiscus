My name is Suad Parvez. I have made this game with my friends about a year ago, with Arsalan Ahmad and Paige Philips. I was the Lead director and contributor for the game.
We used Ms.Philips github to complete the game, as i did not know how to use github at the time. For easier use for others to see this game, it is now in my own github. 

Proof of my work can be provided upon request. 

Side not, we ran this on linux. In other IDE's it may not work without the proper compnay files. But will defintily work on linux
The story about this game is about an person who must reclaim the lost land, the villians 
are past friends of ours; all inner jokes. I hope when you play this game, you will find joy!
